# LinkedIn_Python_Scraper
This is a basic manual on how you could set up a LinkedIn scraper using Python.
Creating a LinkedIn Job Posting Scraper in Python involves using web scraping techniques to extract data from LinkedIn job listings. 
Keep in mind that web scraping LinkedIn is against their terms of service, so it's essential to use this information responsibly and consider using LinkedIn's official API if you need data for legitimate purposes. 
I created this guide for educational use, to demonstrate how to extract job listings automatically so they can be imported into Excel, filtered and tracked more efficiently.
